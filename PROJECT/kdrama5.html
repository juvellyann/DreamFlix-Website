        <p class="summary">
            At the age of eight, Park Joo-hyung (Song Joong-ki) was adopted by an Italian family. He later joins the
            mafia and is
            adopted by Don Fabio, head of the Cassano Family. Renamed “Vincenzo Cassano” he becomes a lawyer, a
            consigliere for the
            mafia, and Don Fabio's right-hand man. After Fabio dies, Paolo, Fabio's biological son and the new leader of
            the Cassano
            Family attempts to kill Vincenzo. He flees to Seoul and sets out to recover 1.5 tons of gold that he helped
            a
            recently-dead Chinese tycoon secretly stash within the basement of Geumga Plaza. However, a subsidiary of
            Babel Group
            has illegally taken ownership of the building, and Vincenzo must use his skills to reclaim the building and
            recover his
            fortunes. At first he comes into conflict with Hong Yoo-chan's daughter, Hong
            Cha-young (Jeon Yeo-been), an attorney for a rival firm, but after her father's death she takes over the
            practice and
            joins forces with Vincenzo and the other tenants to fight Babel Group.
